# Gateway Server Configuration

The Vulcain Gateway Server follows [the twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) and is configurable using [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Note that Let's Encrypt only supports the default port: to use Let's Encrypt, **do not set this variable**.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `READ_TIMEOUT`          | maximum duration for reading the entire request, including the body, set to `0s` to disable (default), example: `2m`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY`    | must contain the secret key to valid subscribers' JWT, can be omitted if `JWT_KEY` is set                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `WRITE_TIMEOUT`         | maximum duration before timing out writes of the response, set to `0s` to disable (default), example: `2m`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `USE_FORWARDED_HEADERS` | set to `1` to use the `X-Forwarded-For`, and `X-Real-IP` for the remote (client) IP address, `X-Forwarded-Proto` or `X-Forwarded-Scheme` for the scheme (http or https), `X-Forwarded-Host` for the host and the RFC 7239 `Forwarded` header, which may include both client IPs and schemes. If this option is enabled, the reverse proxy must override or remove these headers or you will be at risk. |

If `ACME_HOSTS` or both `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` are provided, an HTTPS server supporting HTTP/2 connection will be started.
If not, an HTTP server will be started (**not compatible with HTTP/2 Server Push, and not secure**).
